class BaseExchange:
	"""
		Is the base class from which all Exchanges should inherit.
		Exchanges should implement all the functions outlined here (at least).

		As we add more exchanges to the bot & see different API implementations, 
		we will also update this class - so that it has the most elastic & modular 
		form, in case we observe that more functions are needed or that some need 
		to be updated.
